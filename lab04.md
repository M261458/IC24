## [Q3]
> Briefly describe the file organization in your GitHub repository,
> Where is your presentation? Where is your code and what does it do?
The file organization is built off of the Z-score-by-mean.py. This file creates a new csv called std_nutrient_id and from there, we were able to anaylze the data properly. The presentation file is called 




## [Q4]
> Say a few words about how your team worked together. Who took on the
> role as "team manager"? How did you organize and share your work?
Dan took the lead on figuring out the algroithim to find the differences in the two data sets. After we were able to figure out that, each team member looked into various insights. We ended up seeing the different nutrients that needed to be analyzed, and which ones were stable.

We found that there was missing data in many lines, so we needed to make sure that we accounted for that. Dan wrote an alogritihm that took all of the means from both sets and created a new csv that gave us all of our relevant information. 



## [Q7]
> What did you do to *analyze* the data?

> (Again, just a few sentences with an overall description is good.)



## [Q8]
> How did you create *visualizations* of your analysis?
We used plotly and plotly express for our visualizations. 



## [Q9]
> What concrete recommendations or conclusions did you make?
We recommend that Maitake Mushrooms, Kale, Sunflower Seeds, Soy Flour and Chickpeas are the foods that need to be analyzed. 


## [Q10]
> What tips and suggestions do you have for next year's Info Challenge
> participants?

Start working on the data early.
